# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer:

Researched answer:

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: Git is the local and the difference is git is local storage and Github is remote cloud storage.

Researched answer: Git is a system used in programming. Github is a cloud service tha allows developers to store and manage code.

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer: loose and strict equality operators.

Researched answer: Equality operators, Relational operators, Logical operators.

3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

Your answer: length property of characters in a string.

Researched answer:  Strings have a length property and each character in the string can be accounted for by its placement called an index. Strings are zero indexed meaning the counting of the characters starts at 0 and moves forward.

4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer: arrays hold things and strings are anything wrapped in quotation marks. 
Researched answer: Strings and arrays are quite similar except the length of an array is fixed whereas strings can have a variable number of elements. Technically, arrays are a special type of variable that can hold more than one value at a time. They are a sequential collection of elements of similar data types, whereas strings are a sequence of characters used to represent text rather than numbers. In addition, strings are immutable which means the value of an object cannot be modified once itâ€™s created, while arrays are mutable meaning the fields can be modified.

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer: two developers that take turns coding where one is the driver (that writes the code) and the navigater (researcher and speaks the code to the driver)

Researched answer: The driver is the one with their hands on the keyboard. They are responsible for entering information and following the instructions given by the navigator.
